Welcome to the official documentation site for XM Systems

![](images/Brainiac.jpg)

I'm Xander (AKA Alex) and this site will provide you with all the nerdy details of my homelab.

I work in Infrastructure as an AWS Cloud Engineer and prior to this as an IT Professional for a well known Telecommunications company in the UK.

The previous 8 years of working in this industry have enabled me to build and self-host multiple services popular with many homelabbers.

This site documents everything in my homelab including the devices, the services I run aswell as detail all the code that has been written. 

I have also created a [blog site](https://blog.xmsystems.co.uk) where I will try and post about things I get upto on a regular basis.  Please check this out and subscribe.

If you like what you see, please support me and buy me a beer using the link below.

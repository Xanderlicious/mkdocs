# Welcome

Welcome to the official documentation page for Xander's Homelab

[](index.md)

I'm Xander (AKA Alex) and within this site you will find all the nerdy details of how I've created my homelab.

I work in IT, totally self-taught and I certainly don't claim to be an expert.  

Everything you are about to read will contain explicit details about the different services I host and how I have configured them.  

This sites main purpose is to document everything I can about my systems, the services I run and all the code that has been written.  
*(will help me should anything need re-building)*

If you like what you see, please support me and buy me a beer using the link below.

***Thank You!***

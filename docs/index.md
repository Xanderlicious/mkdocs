# Welcome

Welcome to the official documentation site for my Homelab.

![](images/Brainiac.jpg)

I'm Xander (AKA Alex) and within this site you will find all the nerdy details of how I've created my homelab.

I work in IT, totally self-taught and I certainly don't claim to be an expert.  However, everything you are about to read will contain explicit details about the different services I host and the code I have configured to make it how I want it.  

For me though, this sites main purpose, is to document everything I can about my systems, the services I run and all the code that has been written.  
*(will help me should anything need re-building)*

If you like what you see, please support me and buy me a beer using the link below.

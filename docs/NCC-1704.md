NCC-1704 is a tertiary Pi-Hole instance but this one runs in docker.

This container has a very simply configuration

### docker-compose.yml

```yaml
networks:
  default:
    name: phobos-network
    external: true

services:
  pihole:
    container_name: pihole3
    hostname: ncc-1704
    image: pihole/pihole:latest
    networks:
      default:
        ipv4_address: "172.20.0.10"
    ports:
      - 80:80
      - 443:443
      - 53:53/tcp
      - 53:53/udp
      - 123:123
    environment:
      TZ: Europe/London
    volumes:
      - /ssd/docker/appdata/pihole/etc-pihole:/etc/pihole
      - /ssd/docker/appdata/pihole/etc-dnsmasq.d:/etc/dnsmasq.d
    restart: unless-stopped
```

### Dynamic File

To ensure I can use my domain to reach the dashboard, I have added the regex middleware config to the dynamic file called config.yml and have also created a dynamic file that specifies the domain and calls the middleware.

You can see these in the [Traefik - Dynamic Files](https://docs.xmsystems.co.uk/dynamic/) page

I have also updated the config for [Nebula-Sync](https://docs.xmsystems.co.uk/nebula-sync/) to ensure this is also kept in sync with the other 2 Pi-Holes

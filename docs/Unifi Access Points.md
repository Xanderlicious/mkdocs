I have 2 unifi access points covering the house.

## Unifi U6 Enterprise

This provide a true WiFi 6 connection to the devices that support it as well as WiFi on the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands

## Unifi AC-LR

This only supports 2.4GHz and 5GHz connections but allows seemless roaming with the U6E when moving around the house.


Both of these provide fantastic coverage and are suitably placed to provide excellent wifi coverage regardless of the device being used.
